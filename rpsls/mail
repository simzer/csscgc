Hi Chris,

It's no problem at all. Actually you were quiet fast compared to the 
host of CGC2009 :), and of course it can't stop me flooding the CSSCGC2010.
If I may prove it: 
You can find my third submission attached to the mail. It is a turn based
multiplayer game called Rock/Paper/Scrissors/Lizard/Spock. Its original is
invented by <Sam Kass> and popularized by the american sitcom Big Bang Theory. 
The game is implemented in C and compiled with Z88dk again. 
I used Gimp and its handy "C source" output format for the "visual design".

Note: the color clash at the bottom of spocks hand is not an intended bug.
It is a real spontanious crap, since accidentally I used 10 pixel grid 
instead of 8 for aligning the graphical elements. 

Now I'm out of CGC entry ideas, but I surely will come up with at least one 
more before the end of the year.

Best regards,
Laszlo
