MONObirinth - the straight forward labirinth game

BRIEF DESRIPTION

You have enough of extremly hard - impossible mission games?
This game designed specially for you. 
You have to shepherd the game character 'Mucho'
the wingless mutant half-a-fly through the labirinth.
But don't be afraid, there are no enemies, no time limit,
no ticky traps, and if it is not enough, no junctions at all
since its a one-way-labirint.
So its only up to you and your patience. If you have time, the
win is guaranteed.

DEVELOPMENT BACKGROUND

The game is written in C and compiled with z80dk zcc compiler on linux.
The source is distributed also with the game package.
I haven't found any sprite editor yet on linux so the sprites designed
in text editor (sci-te) and converted to C code data via perl script 
(also part of the package 'spt2c.pl', see 'spt2c/readme' for more info). 
The tap file tested in Fuse (for linux).

CHEATS

Press 'g'(activates Ghost mode) and the walk through the walls.
